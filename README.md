It includes basic concepts and methods of python image library (PIL). 
With PIL you can identify faces in some photos which are not so complex and could work with small datasets. 
Please be aware, It may work better with clean photos like mugshots. If you want higher accuration and willing to work with big datasets, you may need convolutional neural network methods in able to process and get the most precise result.
